# Fit by Science with James
Welcome to Fit by Science - a website dedicated to evidence -based nutrition, and supplementation.
Our goal is to bridge the gap beetween real science and practical application of supplements and nutrition in day to day life and creation of healthy lifestyle movement.
As we all know that we live in an era where enviromental factors (air polution, low quality food, chronic stress) are affecting us immensely, but heads up we are here to share some valuable insigths that can profoundly mitigate the impact of those negative factors on us! Thank you for being a part of our journey it's much appreciated!

## Overview 
Fit by science is an educational and lifestyle platform that helps people: 
- Understand how nutrition truly affects perfomance and health.
- Learn how supplements work - based on real research , not marketing.

## What did I learned
First and foremost I've learned that HTML file follow a consistent structure that is essentialfor web creation. Every tag is a specific mark up for content. HTML file should start from declaration of document. Learned that headings have hierarchy. To add links you need to use <a> tags. Semantic HTML uses tags that carry meaning about their content, not just styling instructions. This creates more accessible websites that work better with assistive technologies, search engines, and other automated systems. HTML5 provides semantic elements like header, nav, main, article, section, aside, and footer that represent common page structures and content types. 

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to style web pages. It controls colours, fonts, spacing and how elements look on the screen. CSS works with selectors (like elements, classes and IDs) and applies properties with values, for example setting text colour or margins. Every element on a page is treated like a box with content, padding, border and margin (the box model). When different rules conflict, the browser decides which one wins based on the cascade and specificity: inline styles are strongest, then IDs, then classes, then basic element selectors.

CSS layout is about how elements are arranged on the page. Elements can behave as block (taking full width and starting on a new line) or inline (sitting in the same line). Modern layouts are usually built with tools like Flexbox and Grid. Flexbox is good for arranging items in a single row or column, such as navigation bars or groups of cards. Grid is better when you want to design both rows and columns at the same time, for example a full page layout or image gallery. Positioning (static, relative, absolute, fixed) allows you to move elements from their normal place when needed.

Responsive design means that a website looks and works well on phones, tablets and larger screens. A common approach is “mobile first”: you design for small screens first and then adjust the layout for bigger screens. This is usually done by using flexible units (such as percentages or relative units instead of only pixels) and by changing styles at certain screen widths using media queries. Images and text should also be flexible so that they resize or wrap nicely instead of overflowing on small screens.

GitHub is an online platform used to store and manage code, and to keep track of changes over time. The basic idea is that you have a repository (a project) where you save your website files. You make commits to record your changes with short messages explaining what you did, and then push these changes from your computer to GitHub. This helps with backup, version control and collaboration with others. GitHub can also host simple websites using GitHub Pages, which lets you share your project as a live site.

Working with images in web development involves choosing the right format, organising files and keeping performance in mind. Common image formats are JPEG for photos, PNG for images that need transparency, SVG for logos and icons, and WebP for modern compressed images. It is good practice to store images in a separate folder, use clear file names and always include alternative text so the image is accessible if it cannot be displayed. Images should be optimised and not too large, so that pages load quickly and work well on all types of devices and internet connections.
