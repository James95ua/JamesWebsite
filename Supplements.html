      <h2>Why supplements at all?</h2>
      <p>
        <em>
          Supplements exist to fill gaps – not to replace real food, sleep, or movement. Even with a
          generally healthy diet, it can be hard to consistently meet all your needs for protein, vitamins,
          minerals, and essential fats, especially in a busy modern lifestyle.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          In some situations, supplements can be genuinely helpful: low sun exposure and vitamin D,
          little or no fish in the diet and omega-3, intense training and higher protein needs, or
          chronically low intake of minerals like magnesium or zinc. Used wisely, they act as tools to
          support your existing habits – not as a shortcut that lets you ignore the basics.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          The goal here is an evidence-based, no-hype approach. We don’t worship supplements and we
          don’t demonize them. Instead, we look at what the research actually shows, where the benefits
          are real, and how you can use a small number of well-chosen products to get the most impact
          with the least confusion.

    <!-- Core Supplements -->
    <section id="core-supplements">
      <h2>Core supplements with the most evidence</h2>
      <p>
        These are the “big rocks” — supplements that are well-studied and can benefit many people,
        especially if diet or lifestyle aren’t perfect.
      </p>

        <article class="supplement-card">
          <h3>Protein powder (whey or plant-based)</h3>
          <p>
            Protein powders are a convenient way to hit your daily protein target when real food isn’t
            enough. They support muscle growth, recovery, and appetite control.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Active people, anyone struggling to eat enough protein.</li>
            <li><strong>Typical use:</strong> 20–30 g per serving, 1–2 times per day as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Choose products with short ingredient lists and minimal added sugar.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="supplement-card">
          <h3>Creatine monohydrate</h3>
          <p>
            Creatine is one of the most researched supplements in sports nutrition. It can increase
            strength, power, and muscle mass, and may even support brain health.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Strength training, high-intensity sports, muscle gain.</li>
            <li><strong>Typical use:</strong> 3–5 g per day, taken consistently (timing is not critical).</li>
            <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Standard creatine monohydrate is enough — no need for special forms.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="supplement-card">
          <h3>Omega-3 (fish oil)</h3>
          <p>
            Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA &amp; DHA) support heart, brain, and joint health and may help
            manage inflammation, especially in people who rarely eat fatty fish.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Low fish intake, joint support, general health.</li>
            <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Look for products with clear EPA/DHA amounts and third-party testing.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="supplement-card">
          <h3>Vitamin D</h3>
          <p>
            Many people, especially in northern climates, are low in vitamin D. Adequate levels support
            bone health, immune function, and mood.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Best for:</strong> People with limited sun exposure.</li>
            <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Works especially well as part of a stack with magnesium and vitamin K2.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="supplement-card">
          <h3>Vitamin K2</h3>
          <p>
            Vitamin K2 helps direct calcium into bones and teeth instead of soft tissues, working as a key
            cofactor alongside vitamin D. This combination supports healthy bones and may help keep
            arteries from accumulating excess calcium.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Best for:</strong> People taking vitamin D regularly, low intake of fermented foods.</li>
            <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Forms like MK-7 are commonly used in supplements with vitamin D3.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="supplement-card">
          <h3>Magnesium</h3>
          <p>
            Magnesium is involved in hundreds of processes in the body, including muscle function,
            sleep, and stress regulation. Many diets are low in magnesium-rich foods.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Poor sleep, muscle cramps, high stress.</li>
            <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Forms like magnesium glycinate or citrate are often better tolerated.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="supplement-card">
          <h3>Zinc</h3>
          <p>
            Zinc plays an important role in immune function, hormone production, skin health, and
            recovery. Intense training, low meat intake, or chronic stress can all increase your needs.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Low meat diets, high training load, frequent illness.</li>
            <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Avoid very high doses long-term, as they can interfere with other minerals.</li>
          </ul>

    <!-- Goal-based Supplements -->
    <section id="goal-based">
      <h2>Supplements by goal</h2>

      <h3>For energy and focus</h3>
      <p>
        Caffeine (used wisely), L-theanine, and proper hydration can support alertness and mental
        performance. The key is avoiding dependency and not masking chronic sleep deprivation.
      </p>

      <h3>For joint and connective tissue support</h3>
      <p>
        Collagen, vitamin C, and sometimes glucosamine/chondroitin are commonly used for joint comfort.
        They work best alongside strength training and a generally anti-inflammatory diet.
      </p>

      <h3>For gut health</h3>
      <p>
        Probiotics, prebiotic fibers, and a diet rich in whole plant foods can support a healthy
        microbiome. Supplements here should complement, not replace, a fiber-rich diet.

    <section id="safety">
      <h2>Safety, quality, and realistic expectations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Supplements should sit on top of good nutrition, sleep, and movement – not replace them.</li>

        <li>Avoid products that promise “instant fat loss” or “miracle transformations.”</li>

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <section id="faq">
      <h2>FAQ: common questions about supplements</h2>

      <h3>Do I need supplements if my diet is already good?</h3>
      <p>
        Maybe not. In many cases, a solid diet can cover most needs. Supplements are most helpful
        when there are clear gaps (low protein, low vitamin D, very low fish intake, etc.).
      </p>

      <h3>Can I take all of these at once?</h3>
      <p>
        You <em>can</em>, but it’s usually smarter to start with one or two based on your main goal
        and how you actually feel. Track your response before adding more.
      </p>

      <h3>How long until I feel a difference?</h3>
      <p>
        Some supplements (like caffeine or creatine loading) can work quickly. Others (like omega-3
        or vitamin D) may take weeks or months to show full benefits. Think long-term, not overnight.
