        <p> <em>Welcome to Fit by Science - a website dedicated to evidence -based nutrition, and supplementation. Our
            goal is to bridge the gap beetween real science and practical application of supplements and nutrition in
            day to day life and creation of healthy lifestyle movement. As we all know that we live in an era where
            enviromental factors (air polution, low quality food, chronic stress) are affecting us immensely, but heads
            up we are here to share some valuable insigths that can profoundly mitigate the impact of those negative
            factors on us!</em></p>
  
            <p><strong><em>Thank you for being a part of our journey it's much appreciated!</em></strong></p>
  
            <h2>Overview of this website</h2>
  
            <p><em>Fit by science with James its your hub for clear, evidence-based advice on <strong><a
                href="https://www.drberg.com/">nutrition</a></strong> and <strong><a
                href="https://ie.iherb.com/">supplements.</a></strong> The goal of this site is to cut through the
            noise, explain the science in plain language, and help you make smart choices that actually fit your life.
          </em></p>
  
          <p><em>On the <strong>Supplements</strong> page, we look at popular products, what the research really says, and
            if they're worth your money - no hype, just honest information. </em></p>
  
            <p><em>On the <strong>Nutrition</strong> page, you'll find practical guidance on building balanced meals,
            managing energy levels, and supporting your training and overall health, through food.</em></p>
  
            <p><em> As you explore, you'll see images of real foods, meals, and common supplements to help you connect the
            information with everyday choices. Whether you're just starting your fitness journey or refining your
            routine, this site is here to give you tools you can trust</em></p>

             <h2>Who this website is for</h2>
  
           <p><em>
            This website is for people who are tired of extreme diets, magic pills, and confusing advice.
            Maybe you have already tried different approaches, lost some weight, gained it back, felt good
            for a while and then ended up in the same place. Here, we slow things down and focus on simple,
            sustainable changes that you can keep for years – not just for a few weeks.
          </em></p>

          <p><em>
            It does not matter if you are a complete beginner, coming back after a long break, or already
            training regularly and just want to sharpen your nutrition and supplementation. The goal is to
            give you clear explanations and tools so that you understand <strong>why</strong> you are doing
            something, not just follow random rules from social media.
          </em></p>

        <h2>How to use this website</h2>
        <p><em>
            You do not have to read everything at once. You can start with the <strong>Homepage</strong> to get a general
            overview, then move to the <strong>Supplements</strong> page if you are curious about which
            products actually make sense, and finally explore the <strong>Nutrition</strong> page to
            improve your everyday eating habits. Think of it as a small library that you can revisit
            whenever you need a reminder or a new idea.
        </em></p>
 
        <p><em>
            As you read, try to connect the information with your own life. Ask yourself simple questions:
            “How does my current breakfast make me feel?”, “Do I rely on sugar or energy drinks to get
            through the day?”, “Am I sleeping enough to recover from training?”. Small honest reflections
            like these can be the start of real change.
        </em></p>

        <h2>Our approach to science</h2>
        <p><em>
            When we say “evidence-based”, we mean that ideas on this website are inspired by real research
            and practical experience, not by trends or marketing. At the same time, science is always
            evolving, and human beings are not robots. That is why you will see balanced messages here:
            we talk about what the research suggests, but we also respect individual differences and
            personal preferences.
        </em></p>
        <p><em>
            You will not find 100% guarantees or promises that “this one trick will fix everything”.
            Instead, you will see explanations of how the body works, what usually helps most people,
            and where supplements or nutrition strategies can realistically move the needle. The final
            decisions are always yours – this site is here to make those decisions easier and more
            informed.
        </em></p>

        <h2>What you will not find here</h2>
        <p><em>
            This website is not about shaming people for their weight, food choices, or fitness level.
            It is not about pushing extreme low-calorie diets, unsustainable workout plans, or expensive
            supplement stacks that promise “miracle results”. We are not chasing perfection; we are
            building a healthier, stronger, and more resilient version of you step by step.
        </em></p>
        <p><em>
            Instead of fear-based messages like “never eat this again”, you will see practical guidance:
            how to reduce sugar without feeling constantly deprived, how to use hunger and fasting in a
            structured way instead of suffering, and how to choose supplements that actually match your
            goals. The focus is always on education, not on guilt.
        </em></p>

        <h2>Next steps on your journey</h2>
        <p><em>
            After reading this overview, a great next step is to visit the <strong>Supplements</strong>
            page and learn which products have the most evidence behind them, and which are probably not
            worth your money. Then, move to the <strong>Nutrition</strong> page to explore ideas such as
            improving meal structure, using intermittent fasting carefully, and reducing added sugar in a
            smart way.
        </em></p>
        <p><em>
            Remember: you do not have to change everything in one day. Even one positive change – a
            slightly better breakfast, one less sugary drink, a small eating window in the evening,
            or a better understanding of supplements – is already progress. This website exists to
            support you in making those small steps, again and again.
