### 1. Fit by science with James 
- My website will be revoloving around **Supplements** and **Nutrition** where I'll be sharing info with consumers on what are the essential supplements for optimal health and welbeing and elaborate on how important nutrition is and how it deeply afects our health and mood.
### 2. My target audience will be:
  - People who are interested in fitness and healthy eating
  - Beginners who want simple guidance on supplementation
  - Potential employers who wants to see my skills in HTML and CSS
### 3. What I plan to include on each page and why:
- **Home page (index.html)**
- Big title and subtitle with a short message about the site
- Introductiory paragraphs that explaine the purpose of the site
- Links to external resources
- Simple navigation menu at the top
- **Nutrition page (nutrition.html)*- Text about balanced meals, energy levels and practical tips
- Maybe a simple list or table of hralty food examples
- **Supplements page (supplements.html)**
- Short explanation of common supplements
- Simple pros and cons in normal language
- **Contact/About page (about.html)**  
  - Short text about me  
  - How to contact me (email or form)
  ## 4. Design decisions (color scheme, layout, typography)
  ### Colour scheme

- Main page background: #f4f3ee – a very light neutral colour that makes text easy to read.
- Header background: #0f173a – a dark navy colour that creates strong contrast and makes the site title stand out.
- Headings (h1, h2): #d97757 – a warm orange that feels energetic and fits the fitness theme.
- Links: #2563eb with a slightly darker blue on hover – a clear blue that users recognise as clickable.
- Footer: uses the text colour as background with black text to visually separate it from the main content.

### Layout choices

- I use a sticky header at the top, so the navigation stays visible when the user scrolls.
- The navigation bar has the logo/title on the left and links on the right, using flexbox for alignment.
- The main content is in a single column with a max-width of 1100px and margin: 0 auto 20px; so text lines are not too wide and stay centered on the page.
- The subtitle under the main heading is centred and has extra margin to create clear visual hierarchy.
- The footer is at the bottom with centred text and padding to give it some breathing space.

### Typography

- I use a basic sans-serif stack: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; because it is clean and easy to read.
- The base font size is 16px with line-height: 1.6 for comfortable reading.
- The main heading (`h1`) is much larger (`2.5rem`) and centre aligned to make the site title the first thing the user sees.
- Subtitles and section headings (`h2`) are slightly smaller but still use the same orange colour to keep the visual style consistent.

## 5. Navigation structure and why I chose it

Navigation is a simple horizontal menu at the top of every page:

- Supplementation, Nutition, Fat-loss tips, and More!
- Nutrition
- Supplements
Ichose this structure, because:
- The menu is always located in the same place easy to navigate
- The list is small so it wont be confusing to the user
- Every link leads to a seperate topic, that's why i kept them seperate

- ## 6. Sketches / wireframes

I plan to draw simple wireframes on paper:

- One sketch for the home page (header + hero text + main content + footer)
- One sketch for a content page 

I will photograph these sketches and add the images to my repository in a wireframes/ folder, then link to them here

## 7. Technologies and tools

I plan to use:
- HTML5 for page structure  
- CSS3 for styling (colours, layout, typography)  
- A simple text editor (Notepad)  
- A web browser (Chrome/Edge) to test the site

## 8. Brief discussion of HTML and CSS evolution

HTML started as a very simple language for linking documents on the web. Early versions mainly supported text, links and basic structure. Over time, HTML added more semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <main> and <footer> to make pages easier to understand for browsers and screen readers.

CSS was created to separate content and presentation. Instead of using many presentational tags in HTML, designers could use CSS to control colours, fonts and layout. Modern CSS includes features like flexbox and grid, which make responsive layouts much easier to build for different screen sizes
- GitHub to store the code and documentation

## 9. HTML tags I plan to use effectively

1. `<header>` – to wrap the top part of the page with the logo and navigation.  
2. `<nav>` – to contain the main navigation links.  
3. `<main>` – to wrap the main content of each page.  
4. `<section>` – to divide content into logical sections.  
5. `<h1>`–`<h3>` – for clear headings and structure.  
6. `<a>` – for links to other pages and external resources.
