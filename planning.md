### 1. My website will be revoloving around **Supplements** and **Nutrition** where I'll be sharing info with consumers on what are the essential supplements for optimal health and welbeing and elaborate on how important nutrition is and how it deeply afects our health and mood.
### 2. My target audience will be:

- Introductiory paragraphs that explaine the purpose of the site
- Links to external resources
- Simple navigation menu at the top
- **Nutrition page (nutrition.html)*- Text about balanced meals, energy levels and practical tips
- Maybe a simple list or table of hralty food examples
- **Supplements page (supplements.html)**
- Short explanation of common supplements
- Simple pros and cons in normal language
- **Contact/About page (about.html)**  
  - Short text about me  
  - How to contact me (email or form)
  ## 4. Design decisions (color scheme, layout, typography)

### Colour scheme

- Main page background: #f4f3ee – a very light neutral colour that makes text easy to read.
- Header background: #0f173a – a dark navy colour that creates strong contrast and makes the site title stand out.
- Headings (h1, h2): #d97757 – a warm orange that feels energetic and fits the fitness theme.
- Links: #2563eb with a slightly darker blue on hover – a clear blue that users recognise as clickable.
- Footer: uses the text colour as background with black text to visually separate it from the main content.

### Layout choices

- I use a sticky header at the top, so the navigation stays visible when the user scrolls.
- The navigation bar has the logo/title on the left and links on the right, using flexbox for alignment.
- The main content is in a single column with a max-width of 1100px and margin: 0 auto 20px; so text lines are not too wide and stay centered on the page.
- The subtitle under the main heading is centred and has extra margin to create clear visual hierarchy.
- The footer is at the bottom with centred text and padding to give it some breathing space.

### Typography

- I use a basic sans-serif stack: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; because it is clean and easy to read.
- The base font size is 16px with line-height: 1.6 for comfortable reading.
- The main heading (`h1`) is much larger (`2.5rem`) and centre aligned to make the site title the first thing the user sees.
- Subtitles and section headings (`h2`) are slightly smaller but still use the same orange colour to keep the visual style consistent.
