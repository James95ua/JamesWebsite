      <h2>Nutrition: lifestyle first, diet second</h2>
      <p>
        <em>
          Food is one of the main signals you send to your body every day. It shapes your energy,
          mood, body composition and long-term health. The goal is not to suffer on a “perfect diet”,
          but to build a way of eating that respects how your body actually works.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          Here we focus on two powerful ideas: giving your body regular time <strong>without food</strong>
          (intermittent fasting) and reducing your exposure to constant <strong>added sugar</strong>.
          These are simple, science-backed levers that can make people stop and think about how
          they live, not just what they eat.
        </em>
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Foundations -->
    <section id="nutrition-foundations">
      <h2>Simple foundations before any “hack”</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Base most of your meals on whole, minimally processed foods.</li>
        <li>Include a source of protein in almost every meal to support muscle and satiety.</li>
        <li>Fill your plate with vegetables and some fruit for fiber, vitamins, and minerals.</li>
        <li>Use carbs and fats to match your activity, not as constant background snacking.</li>
        <li>Eat most of your calories while you are active and awake, not late at night.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Intermittent fasting -->
    <section id="intermittent-fasting">
      <h2>Intermittent fasting: why structured hunger can help</h2>
      <p>
        <em>
          Our bodies are not designed for 16 hours of constant grazing. Periods without food allow
          insulin levels to drop, fat stores to be used, and cellular “cleanup” processes to turn on.
          For many people, <strong>structured hunger</strong> is not punishment – it is a reset signal.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        When you give your digestive system a real break, the body gets a chance to switch from
        constant storage mode to repair and maintenance. People often report clearer thinking,
        more stable energy, and easier fat loss when they stop eating from morning until late
        night and move to a clear eating window.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intermittent fasting is not magic and not for everyone (for example, it may not be
        appropriate for some medical conditions or eating disorders), but for many otherwise
        healthy adults it can be a powerful, simple structure that brings awareness back to
        hunger, habits, and true need for food.

          <h3>16/8 rhythm</h3>
          <p>
            One of the most popular approaches: 16 hours without food, 8-hour eating window.
            For example, first meal at 12:00, last meal at 20:00.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Skip late-night snacking and very early breakfast.</li>
            <li>Keep 2–3 solid meals instead of constant grazing.</li>
          </ul>

        <article class="supplement-card">
          <h3>12/12 as a gentle start</h3>
          <p>
            Even a simple 12 hours without food (for example 20:00–8:00) is already better than
            eating until midnight. This is a realistic first step for most people.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Helps align eating with your natural sleep–wake rhythm.</li>
            <li>Easy way to “close the kitchen” after a certain time.</li>

        <article class="supplement-card">
          <h3>Fasting is not starvation</h3>
          <p>
            The idea is to give the body time to rest from food, not to destroy yourself with
            extreme restriction. During your eating window, meals should still be nourishing
            and satisfying.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Listen to your body and increase the fasting window gradually.</li>
            <li>If you feel worse and worse, not better – change the approach.</li>

    <!-- Sugar section -->
    <section id="sugar">
      <h2>Sugar: why “just a little” all day is a problem</h2>
      <p>
        <em>
          Sugar itself is not a moral issue, but constant added sugar keeps blood glucose and insulin
          bouncing up and down all day. Over time this can drive weight gain, cravings, and increased
          risk for metabolic diseases.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The modern problem is not one dessert at a family gathering. It is hidden sugar in breakfast
        cereals, sauces, drinks, coffee add-ons, snacks, and “healthy” bars – every few hours, every day.
        The body almost never gets a break from the “quick energy” signal.
      </p>
      <p>
        You <strong>can live with almost no added sugar</strong> and still enjoy food: whole fruit for
        sweetness, quality dark chocolate in moderation, and recipes based on real ingredients instead
        of constant packaged treats. For many people, this shift alone changes how they feel in a few weeks.
